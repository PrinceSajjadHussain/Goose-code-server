## Troubleshooting

### Goose AI Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Goose not found | Ensure the installation was successful with `which goose` |
| Configuration errors | Run `goose configure` to set up the agent manually |
| API key issues | Verify your OpenAI API key is correctly set in the `.env` file |
| Session errors | Check if your model is supported by running `goose model list` |

### Container Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Port conflicts | Change the port mapping in your docker run command |
| Permission issues | Container uses the `coder` user; use `sudo` for privileged operations |
| Performance issues | Adjust Docker resource allocation in Docker Desktop settings |
